As the groups were created by the company it was difficult to contact each and every person and
coordinate as a team..
The purpose of making groups are to make numerous ideas come together and create a combination of
all the ideas. Since the teammates were didnâ€™t know each other it took a lot of time for few people to
speak up about what they wanted and their way of doing the project.
Overall it was a very new experience which made us learn about a lot of things including teamwork and
what it actually means.
